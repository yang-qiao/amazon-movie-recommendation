    "The goal of this notebook is to develop a sampling method to select movie ratings from the original 5-core Amazon Movies and TV dataset. We start by writing a sampling function that takes proportion as a parameter and then pass in different sample proportions to obtain datasets with different sample sizes. These samples will later be used to study how the overall recommendation accuracy changes and how run-time scales as sample size changes from small to large."

    "I changed the sampling methodology a bit. It turns out we can't just filter movies and users just once because when we remove users, that changes the number of reviews per movie, and vice versa. So, we have to iteratetively filter to convergence. I initially wrote make_sample for spark dataframes, but it turns out that running this locally is quite slow, so I wrote an identical implementation for pandas, which was lightning fast! So for data sampling, I just did everything in pandas but left the spark code here anyways."

If we directly take a small random sample at this sparsity level, the density of the resulting dataset could be even lower and runs the risk of negatively affecting the quality of our recommendations. To correct for this, we restrict each of our samples to be above a certain density level by controlling the minimum number of ratings a movie and a user can have. \n",

However, this threshold can be changed based on different sample sizes and desired density levels.

In the make_sample function, I call $k$ the threshold.
