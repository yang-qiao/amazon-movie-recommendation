    "The goal of this notebook is to develop a sampling method to select movie ratings from the original 5-core Amazon Movies and TV dataset. We start by writing a sampling function that takes proportion as a parameter and then pass in different sample proportions to obtain datasets with different sample sizes. These samples will later be used to study how the how run-time scales as sample size changes from small to large."
